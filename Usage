python nasa_campss.py
The script will:

Download the CMAPSS dataset (FD001). [file:1]

Load and clean the training data.

Compute RUL per engine unit and generate time-series windows of length 50. [file:1]

Build and train a hybrid LSTM model for:

RUL (regression).

High-risk failure classification within a threshold (e.g., 30 cycles). [file:1]

Plot training/validation MAE and accuracy curves. [file:1]

You can modify key hyperparameters in nasa_campss.py:

SEQUENCE_LENGTH

RISK_THRESHOLD

Model layer sizes, dropout rates, and loss weights.

Number of epochs and batch size.
